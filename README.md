# Call Center Analysis || Power-BI

### ðŸ’  Project Overview

- The Call Center Analysis project utilizes Power BI to analyze and evaluate key aspects of call center operations, including total calls, resolution rates, abandoned calls, agent performance, and customer 
  satisfaction.
- The analysis highlights patterns in call volume by time and day, identifies top-performing agents, and pinpoints areas needing improvement, such as response times and unresolved issues.
- By providing interactive and visually intuitive dashboards, the project equips stakeholders with actionable insights to optimize resource allocation, improve service quality, and enhance customer satisfaction. - This data-driven approach supports better decision-making to address operational challenges effectively.
- 
### ðŸ’  Problem Statement

-How can we reduce the number of abandoned calls and improve the overall call resolution rates?

- Which agents are performing well, and who requires additional support or training to enhance their efficiency?

- What are the key factors contributing to low customer satisfaction ratings, and how can they be addressed?

- Are there specific days or times when call volumes peak?

- How can we optimize response times and workload distribution among agents to improve service quality?

- What topics or issues generate the highest volume of calls, and how can we proactively address them?

- How can insights from this analysis help in resource planning and enhancing the customer experience?

27.08% of the calls were unresolved, which highlights areas where better resolution processes might be needed.

#### âž¼ Average Speed of Answer:

The average time to answer a call was 67.52 seconds, indicating some delays in connecting with customers. Reducing this can improve customer satisfaction.

## âœ… Detailed Visual Analysis:

#### 1] Calls Resolved/Not Resolved by Month:

The breakdown by month shows:
January: Highest number of resolved calls (1,311), but also the most unresolved calls (461).
February and March: Slightly fewer calls than January, but the resolution rates remain consistent.

#### 2] Total Calls by Weekday:

The call volume is highest on Monday (770) and Saturday (768), and slightly lower on weekdays like Tuesday (675).
Insights: Staffing on peak days like Monday and Saturday might need adjustment to handle higher traffic.

#### 3] Total Calls by Hour:

Calls peak between 11 AM to 3 PM, with 12 PM being the busiest hour (590 calls).
The volume drops sharply after 5 PM.
Insights: Agents should be more available during peak hours for better handling of call volumes.

#### 4] Answered and Abandoned Calls by Topic:

Calls related to Streaming and Payment Issues had the highest abandonment rates, despite being common topics.
Technical Support calls were handled relatively well, indicating better resolution processes in that area.

## âœ…- Filters and Interactivity:
The dashboard includes several filters for:

Date: Users can adjust the time frame to view specific periods.

Month: Allows analysis of monthly trends.

Agent and Topic: Helps to drill down into individual agent performance or specific call topics.

## âœ… Findings and Recommendations:

#### 1] Call Handling:

- With 946 calls abandoned, improving the availability of agents during peak hours can enhance response rates.

#### 2] Customer Satisfaction:

- An average rating of 3.40 indicates the need for better training, faster resolutions, and improved processes to enhance customer experience.

#### 3] Resolution Rates:

- While 72.92% resolution is good, focusing on unresolved calls can further improve customer trust and retention.

#### 4] Peak Hours and Days:

- Reinforce staffing during peak times (11 AM - 3 PM) and busier days (Monday and Saturday) to handle higher call volumes efficiently.

#### 5] Topic-Specific Insights:

- Focus on Streaming and Payment-related issues as these areas see high abandonment rates, which can negatively impact customer perception.
